# Data Engineering - build a data pipeline around New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) trip record data - pickups and drop-offs

## This project intents to utilise the following technologies to emulate real world data engineering project:

1. Kafka: Streaming
2. PostgreSQL and SQL: Data Analysis & Exploration
3. Docker: Containerization
4. Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Cloud-based auto-scaling platform by Google
5. Google Cloud Storage (GCS): Data Lake
6. Terraform: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)
7. Airflow or Prefect: Pipeline Orchestration
8. DBT: Data Transformation
9. Spark: Distributed Processing
10. Phyton programming
11. Version control: Git/GitHub


## Setting up the environment

Test and verify that docker is working by creating image and running container.

Create postgreSQL container and pull data from NYC TLC website (https://www.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)
